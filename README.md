# **FakerDex**

Overview: 

Full-stack react-on-rails Pokedex application. 
Functional and interactive, this web application displays Pokemon data taken from the gem 'faker'. 
The user can add Pokemon to the list, edit and delete functionality still need to be added. 
The addition of sprites will need to be revisited.

# Approach & Challenges

I wanted ot build a fully functional Pokedex that would display all the Pokemon and their information. I first tried to find an API to help feed the data, 'pokegenerator' was the first choice. I had difficulty in getting it to seed the data and all examples i found online didn't use 2 separate servers. As a deadline was due i went back and used the gem 'faker' to seed all the data on pokemon. This led to the information being random and not accurate. 
The application so far is able to show, and add new data. 

Eventually i found a new Rails Api that was built for Pokemon Data. Revisiting this App i would use this Rails API and built the front-end around it. Adding a delete and update function was also tricky as i realised i need a stronger grasp on React. This project was fun and challenging, the biggest takeaway is that I will need to practise more on Rails and React. Having just one model, i'd like to redo this project with a many to many model and use better css/ scss to style a Pokedex and include moving sprites.
